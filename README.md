🔧 How to Use
Each file is named according to its task, e.g., task03_min_element.py

Run files individually to test logic

Most programs use input() — be ready to enter values during execution

🚀 What's Next
✅ Completed Phase 1 and Phase 2

🔜 Start Phase 3: Recursion + LeetCode Easy on 13th July 2025

📌 Future plans:

Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming

System Design + AI/ML Projects (2026+)
